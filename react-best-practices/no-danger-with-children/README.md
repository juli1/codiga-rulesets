This rule shows a warning when a DOM element or component is using both children and the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop at the same time.

React will throw a warning if this rule is ignored.

This rule is similar to the [react/no-danger-with-children](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-danger-with-children.md) rule from ESLint.
