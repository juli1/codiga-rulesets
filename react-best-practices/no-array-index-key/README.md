Warns if an element uses an Array index as its key.

The key is used by React to identify which items were added, removed, or updated. This allows React to determine which elements can remain stable between renders.

Using an array index as a key isn't recommended because React can't uniquely identify your elements or components, which can lead to unnecessary renders.

Example:
- You are using an array index as your key for a list of components and you remove a component near the middle of your list. 
- All of your components after that removed element will be re-rendered because their key value has changed. 

Solution:
- By using a unique identifier for your components like an `id` or a `name` you can save yourself and your application from these unnecessary re-renders.
