In ECMAScript 2015, the keywords "let" and "const" was introduced for block-scope variable declaration. 

Variables declared with "const" are read-only and cannot be reassigned. Using "let" instead of "var" can help prevent confusion and issues related to variable scope. 

While these new keywords provide more precise variable types, they may require some refactoring and may cause syntax errors in older environments. 

It is recommended to use "let" or "const" instead of "var" in environments that support ECMAScript 2015.
